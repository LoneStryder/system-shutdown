  To reference original songs, use their name in the files! You don't need the path, just the filename. This works for any songs in these folders:
  Content/Music
  Content/DLC/Music
  
  To Play your own songs, use the path to that song in your extension.
  For example, try changing the song name below to "Music/Chemical_Burns.ogg" - it'll start with that instead for new saves! -->

  <!-- Workshop Details -->
  
  <WorkshopDescription>You've been a retired hacker for quite some time, until an old friend contacts you saying it's time to bring the gang back together.

One of CSEC's top operatives has gone rogue, bringing with him an arsenal of powerful and experimental hacking tools. You and your team are going to find this hacker, and take back what he stole. But once you succeed, what will you decide to do with them?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is currently an unfinished expansion for Hacknet following a new protagonist and taking place after the events of Hacknet and Hacknet: Labyrinths.

System Shutdown currently includes:

- Between 1-2 hours of gameplay.
- A thorough introduction covering the basics.
- A new cast of detailed characters.
- 2 complete main questlines. (5 Planned)
- A few entertaining side missions.
- Various nodes and networks to explore.
- (Soon to be a few easter eggs, but their areas haven't been added yet.)

And an accidental jumpscare near the end. ;P

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#HackerJAM honourable mention as a close competitor for third place. An exceptional re-introduction to Hacknet.
