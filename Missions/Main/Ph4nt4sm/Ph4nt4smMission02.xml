    <subject>Port Issues</subject>
    <body>I've checked the IP you sent me. That system's got us on the right track! It seems she's improved her botnet too...
	
	
I see she's got port 554 locked tight, luckily I may have a solution to that. I've been researching that mysterious port for a while and apparently a collaboration of hackers have been working on a homemade tool designed to pop this port wide open.
	
Hear me out, the project's called RTSPSmasher and from what I've heard it works. I'll provide you a link to one of their machines but be careful. They probably won't be keeping a project like this on any old system, so my guess is you'll have to do some digging to find it.
	
If you're leaving logs around like Ph4nt4sm does, then you may as well kiss your PC goodbye. These guys aren't amateurs, so take your time and be methodical.
	
	
Reply back if you manage to get into Ph4nt4sm's botnet server.</body>
