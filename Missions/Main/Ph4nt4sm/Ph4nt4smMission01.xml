    <body>Finally, I think we can start getting the team back together.
	
	
Unfortunately for us it won't be easy to track them down, after we all parted ways most covered their tracks extraordinarily well, with an exception however.

From what I know Ph4nt4sm continued her hacking gig solo after you left the scene. Coming from a white-hat background, she's an expert at pen-testing and can find her way around a network easily. We'll need her botnet expertise for the job.

Like I said however, she was the exception. Naturally running a botnet makes it near-impossible to clean up all your logs, plus her added ignorance makes for a guaranteed way to find her. I've managed to find a system she used in a previous attack so I'm hoping there are still traces of her tampering left behind.

Also I've updated our asset stash with all the tools I could find, you should copy them when you have the time.

I should be getting back to finding evidence of where the others are, so I'm going to need you to snoop around and see if she's left any evidence of her whereabouts.
	
If you find anything useful, like an IP address to a system of hers, reply to me with it and I'll take a look when I have the time.


We're on the clock, so get to it #PLAYERNAME#.</body>
