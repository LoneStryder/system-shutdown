    <body>Congrats, you beat the trials!
	
I know they seem simple but trust me, you needed them. Not hacking for a while makes you irrelevant quicker than a WhoTube hiatus.

Anyway I'm sending you the links to the IRC and asset stash, so far the stash only has ThemeChanger.exe but I'll expand our library as time goes on. I'm gonna start poking around for any hints on the others whereabouts so for now I'll list a few jobs up on the IRC for you. Just choose one and I'll patch you through to the client.

This'll all be worth it, I promise.</body>
