    <body>Hey #PLAYERNAME#, glad you decided to join me in this.
	
	
A lot has changed since you've been gone.
	
One of CSEC's best goons has gone rogue, and he's apparently got some experimental tools on him. The rumours paint these tools out to be huge, capable of multi-port breaches and instant wiping of rival's systems among other things. I know they're full of crap but this could be hinting at something valuable. I think it's time we got the team back together.
	
Anyway I know you quit hacking a long time ago so I'm gonna set you a few challenges to get you back up and running on the new rig. You ready?
	
By the way, don't worry yourself about what the guy's capable of, we managed to pry Hacknet out of EnTech's servers didn't we?
	
Just reply when you want to start the trials.</body>
