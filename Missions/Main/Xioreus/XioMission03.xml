    <subject>The Ports Strike Back</subject>
    <body>Great, another port we can't break into, deja vu much?
	
Luckily this port isn't nearly as hard to find a tool for, so we should be fine.
	
I'll send you the IP to a guy that might have the program we need, MIGHT is the keyword there.
	
Reply back when you have a copy, whether it's from him or not.</body>
