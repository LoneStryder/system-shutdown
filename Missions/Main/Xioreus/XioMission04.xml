    <subject>A Message to Xio</subject>
    <body>Finally, we're in.
	
Now all you need to do is find Xio's PC and drop him the message I've created.

I've heavily encrypted the message too, just to see if he's still got what it takes. (And to piss him off for a while.) As always you'll find it on the asset server.

Reply to me when you've done it.</body>
