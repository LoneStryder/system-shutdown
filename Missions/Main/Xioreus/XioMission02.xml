    <body>This is definitely the file Z10N would've taken, how did you get this?

No matter, I'm adding one of my programs to the asset server, it's called DECHead. It should help you find out where this file came from and, hopefully, where Z10N is located.

If you have any trouble as always, send me the IP address.</body>
