    <body>Hey #PLAYERNAME#, I think I've found us another missing member, but getting to them is going to be tricky.
	
	
Lynx used to work for the security firm "Psylance" and by the looks of things they've had an intrusion to their network. It could be any hacker who performed the attack but the name of the employee involved sounded oddly familiar.
	
Tom Michaels is the victim of the attack, he used to be a co-worker of Lynx's and apparently gave him tons of sh*t for his work. I think the asshole was just jealous of Lynx's skills. He made Lynx's life a living hell and eventually managed to get him fired for a mistake he didn't make, the bastard.
	
Of course this COULD just be a coincidence but honestly I doubt anyone intending to break into a security firm's network would only be after one person. I think it's worth investigating since we're unlikely to find any other leads any time soon.
	
Look around their network for a report document of some kind, also if it's encrypted do me a favour and decrypt it before sending it to me would ya?
	
I've linked you to Psylance's employee IRC chat, they tend to insult their client's stupidity so let's see if you can shame them and get into their network.
