    <body>Nice, you actually found what we need!

Looks like Psylance have produced a new batch of memory dumps for the forensics team to analyze, how about we check those dumps instead?

If you find anything related to Lynx in those memory dumps, wipe them from Psylance's servers. Make sure to keep a copy for yourself though.

Delete their dump generator too for good measure. We don't want Psylance coming after you instead.

Reply back if you find your way into any of Lynx's systems.
