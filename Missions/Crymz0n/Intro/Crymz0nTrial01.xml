    <body>Right, lets get started then.
	
	
Remember our old asset stash? The one with all the good stuff? Well it was wiped by some jackass named Naix a few months back. I'm gonna have you breach our backup stash to see what you can find. We stopped using the backup early on so it should have weak enough security that you can breach it on your own. Just run PortHack and you should be fine. Breach the system to complete the challenge.

I've also attached a link to and old archive I found, it should teach you anything I forget to mention.

One more thing, I'm sending you a program just in case it's tougher than expected. It's called SSHCrack, check your /bin directory for it.
To run it just type 'SSHCrack' and then the port number. Usually it's 22.
	
Good luck.</body>
