    <body>Nice, you made it to the final challenge!
	
	
The final challenge will need you to break into a corporations mainframe and copy an encrypted file to your machine. Just upload it to our new drop server and you're done.

Once you've passed the challenge I'll send you a link to our old IRC chat. I've wiped the old messages so we can start fresh.

There's one more security measure I haven't told you about, but you probably already knew everything I've taught you anyway. Corporations and professional hackers often use what we call a proxy. It's gonna restrict you from running any programs until it's bypassed. In order to bypass it you'll want to run the 'shell' command on any computer you have access to and when you're ready, overload the proxy with your systems.

That concludes Crymz0n's noob guide to hacking. See you on the other side!</body>
