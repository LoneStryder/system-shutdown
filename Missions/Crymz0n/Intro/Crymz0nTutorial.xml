    <body>Hey #PLAYERNAME#, glad you decided to join me in this.
	
	
A lot has changed since you've been gone.
	
One of CSEC's best goons has gone rogue, and he's apparently got some experimental tools on him. It's only rumour, but those tools can apparently breach any port imaginable and completely wipe rival's machines in an instant. I know they're full of crap but this could be hinting at something valuable. I think it's time we got the team back together.
	
Anyway I know you've quit hacking for some time so I'm gonna set you a few challenges to get you back up and running on the new rig. You ready?
	
By the way, don't worry yourself about what the guy's capable of, we managed to get away with stealing copies of Hacknet now didn't we?
	
Just reply when you want to start the trials.</body>
