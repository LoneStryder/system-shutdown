    <body>Sigh, I'm not proud of what I'm about to tell you but here goes. Whilst searching for clues on the team I stumbled into a Script Kiddie's system... and he DDoSed me.

Normally if this ever happened I'd deal with it myself, but since we're on an unknown time limit I'm asking you to take care of this for me. Security-wise there shouldn't be a problem, I'd be surprised if they even knew what an antivirus was so this job'll be a breeze.

Check the asset server, I've provided a fake script for you to upload. If he finally figures out the script's named incorrectly and fixes it then... let's just say his 'hacking' days will come to a swift end, if you catch my drift.

Also check for any backups of the script he might have we don't want him being a nuisance again anytime soon.

Thanks for taking care of this.</body>
