    <body>#PLAYERNAME#, we have a small problem.
	
Whilst searching for clues as to where the others are, I stumbled upon and was DDoSed by a script kiddie. Knowing that they might have my IP, they could potentially halt this entire operation for WEEKS!

Normally in circumstances like this, I'd take care of it myself, but seeing as though I have a lot of work to do and so little time, I'm going to need you to do it for me.
Don't worry about security, they probably don't even know what an antivirus is so this job'll be a breeze.

Check the asset server, I've uploaded a fake script. If he finally figures out that the script has a different name and fixes it then... let's just say his hacking days will come to a swift end, if you catch my drift.

Also check for any backups of the script he may have, we don't want him becoming active again anytime soon.
	
Thanks for taking care of this.</body>
