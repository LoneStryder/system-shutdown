    <body>Hey #PLAYERNAME#, thanks for trying the demo for our upcoming expansion to Hacknet, CODENAME: Downfall.
	
We are currently working on improving the main extension by adding new characters, questlines and more.

Your support is what keeps us developing this extension, without your help CODENAME: Downfall would be either abandoned or a buggy mess.

If you liked our extension or have encountered any bugs along the way, don't hesitate to message us on our Steam Workshop page.

We hope you enjoyed our taster of what's soon to come.
