    <subject>A Unique Mod</subject>
    <body>So, erm, yeah this job is weird.
	
So a bunch of people from the Digbuild community have asked to have a mod deleted from their community forums. Apparently it was that bad that they started a petition to get the mod removed, but the admins refused. In my opinion, they're all dumb kids whining about a simple game mod, but the funds they've saved up could buy some new RAM for the IRC so... I'm not complaining.

The mod in question is the Potatoes+ Mod... ugh this job sounds pettier by the second...

Look, just get the mod deleted and we get paid, alright? Good.</body>
