    <body>I'll make this quick, since I'd like this guy dealt with asap.
	
I caught our IRC's IP address floating around the Blackhat forums a little while ago, a script kiddie has been DDoSing us ever since.

He's probably just wants our attention, so that's exactly what we'll give him. Hack into his PC and delete whatever DDoS tool he's using.

Also you're free to deal as much collateral to his system as you want, if that's up your alley.

This errand's an easy one, enjoy it.</body>
