    <body>Hey, sorry to pull you off work but this is urgent.
	
	
I think I've found a lead as to where Z10N is located, but it's not going to be easy. I found an IRC log of a few freelance hackers talking about a recent file raid Z10N was on. Apparently he stole an important data report and the corporation's going nuts! 

Z10N's always been the decryption expert, so I'm guessing the file he's taken was encrypted. Let's hope Z10N's left something behind that could help us find him.

I'm sending you the IP to the company's web server, you should be able to access the rest of the network from it. Like last time if you find anything you need me to check, like an IP or a file, send or upload it to me.


We need Z10N's skills on hand. Good luck.</body>
