    <body>Wait.. You found it?!
	
Well, I didn't expect that.Good job!

Anyway, Z10N actually managed to find me a working, STABLE version of memdumpgenerator. Lucky for us ey?

It's on the asset stash. I'd recommend going back and taking a look at Michaels' system with it. Maybe you'll pick up Lynx's trace?

Reply back if you get into a system of Lynx's.
