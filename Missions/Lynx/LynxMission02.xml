    <body>Welp... this is definitely bad.
	
Looks like the hacker involved (likely Lynx) is number 1 on Psylance's radar. The intrusion was definitely a direct attack on Tom. They might have even damaged the network security along the way, that probably explains why it was so easy to break into for a security firm...
	
Right then, now our top priority is tracking this hacker down before Psylance does. We're already behind since they have the tools for the job - unlike us. But no need to worry, I have a plan!
	
Psylance have called in memory forensics experts to trace the attack back to the source, if we break into their systems we'll find the tools needed ripe for the taking!
	
The hard part is knowing where to start; I suppose I could link you to Tom's PC and hope you find a way to the investigators from there. 
	
Take a look around, I'll keep searching for other methods. If luck's on our side, you should find a one-way ticket to the forensics tools. If not, we may be out of luck.
	
Reply back if you find anything handy... and hurry!
