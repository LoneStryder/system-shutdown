    <body>Oh... This is bad
	
	It appears as though the hacker, (hopefully Lynx) is in it deep. They attacked an employee outright. They might have even done a little damage to the company systems too. In fact, that probably explains why the security was so weak for a security firm...
	
	Whatever, right now our top priority is tracking this hacker down before Psylance does. Obviously we're slightly behind since they already have the tools for the job - whereas we don't. Ah but don't worry I have a plan!
	
	Why not track down their forensics agents and take the tools.
	
	The hard part is where to start; I suppose I could link you to the system of the guy who was attacked but I doubt there'd be anything there. 
	
	Snoop around there until I find something else. If lucks on our side, you may find something useful, like a log or an email or something... Maybe even the forensics tool itself?
	
	Reply back if you do manage to find something useful... Hurry!
