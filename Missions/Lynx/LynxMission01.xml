    <body>Hey #PLAYERNAME#, I think I have an idea on another member's whereabouts, but I think that this is gonna be a little tricky.
	
	If you don't recall, Lynx was our memory forensics expert. He was a fanatic back in the day and the best at what he did. However, I've been poking around a security firm called "Psylance" and it seems as though they're performing an investigation into a breach in one of the staff member's PC's.
	
	Now, obviously this hacker could be anyone, however, Lynx used to work for Psylance security and the system that was attacked was an old co-worker's of Lynx. One that I hear gave him a lot of trouble way back when.
	
	This of course just could be a mere coincedence but it's the most promising lead I have for now and since there's no more work for you right now, there's no harm done investigating, right?
	
	Anyway, we're not getting anywhere without looking into them reports so go see if you can grab a copy off the server. If you do, upload me a decrypted copy would you?
	
	I've linked you to an IRC that Psylance employees tend to use, see if you can find your way into their servers from there.
