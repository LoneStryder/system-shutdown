    <body>I've checked the IP you sent me. That system's got us on the right track! It seems she's improved her botnet too...
	
	
Port 554 is locked? No problem; I performed some research into a cracking tool that we could use to get through the port and into Ph4nt4sm's system.
	
Hear me out, this shady looking group of hackers collaborated on a project called RTSPSmasher. I'll provide you a link to one of their machines, however do be careful. They're very likely not to store such a valuable project on one of their regular systems, my guess is you'll have to root around for it.
	
I know I don't have to tell you of all people this, but be careful. These guys aren't amateurs so remember to take your time and be methodical.
