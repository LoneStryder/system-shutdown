    <body>Right, I think it's about time we start getting the gang back together.
	
	
Unfortunately for us, it won't be as easy to track them down as it was to track you. Most of them have covered their tracks extraordinarily well... with an exception however.

Our old friend Ph4nt4sm continued her hacking career solo after you left the scene. She may be a black-hat, but she has good intentions at heart. We're going to need her skills and tools to help with our project.

Like I said, she was the exception. She may be a damn good hacker, capable of breaching systems in minutes, but she's sloppy when it comes to logs. Whilst scrawling for clues on her status I found a system that contained an IP from one of her old botnet computers.

Also I've updated our asset stash with all the tools I could find, you should copy them when you have the time.

I should be getting back to finding evidence of where the others are, so I'm going to need you to snoop around and see if she's left any evidence of her whereabouts.
	
If you find anything useful, like an IP address to a system of hers, reply to me with it and I'll take a look when I have the time.


We've got no time to lose, so get to it #PLAYERNAME#.</body>
