	We have. Unfortunately we can only spare one member at this moment in time, we have a lot on our hands as you can imagine.
	
	The member in question is "Randy Newell" and he's excellent at what he does.
	
	Newell also fortified his system recently... conesquently from the recent attack.

	Ah yes. Newell.
	
	I've seen his security, it looks impenetrable.
	
	I assume his system IP is still "216.192.8.5"? If so then I'll send him some details right away.
