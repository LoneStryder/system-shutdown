   Before I even sat down, Robyn started yelling at me to de-sync my laptop from my phone. Why? I really don't understand why he's worrying. I'll do it some other time, right now I'm focused on the task at hand... taking notes

   So far, the project is running flawlessly. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before! So how it works is it... well I don't really know how it works! (0_0)
   The program has a few kinks but they are already being patched as I'm typing this.
   One thing I did pick up is that the spindown time on this program is phenomenally longer compared to other cracking tools! It's probably much faster to kill the process when it's finished it's job rather than waiting for the ridiculously slow spindown.
