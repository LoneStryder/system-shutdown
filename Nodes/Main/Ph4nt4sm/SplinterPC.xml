  Robyn asked me to quickly do a write up of the project... even though I haven't even seen it in action yet! How does he expect me to write about something I haven't seen!?!
  How do I even know it works? They're all amateurs. Why am I even working with them?!
  
  At least tomorrow I FINALLY get to see this cracking tool, IRL. I suppose I'll have to bring my NetBook to make notes though...
  
  Ughh.

   So, my phone charger's plug broke so I've had to connect it to my NetBook. It's not ideal but for the time being, my phone lives to see another day. 
   
   NOTE TO SELF: Buy a new ePhone charger plug!
