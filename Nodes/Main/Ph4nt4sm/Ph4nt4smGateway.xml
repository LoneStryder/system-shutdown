  <file path="home/Work" name="Upgraded_Defenses.txt">I just came to the realisation that I need to take extra precautions in my line of work. 
  Luckily enough I managed to reverse engineer this program I found on the deep web; RTSPSmasher or better known as "RTSPCrack". It allows the opening of port 554 and for me, an extra port to add to my security. 
  Not many people know of this little gem... better off not knowing really, that'll make me semi-impenetrable.</file>

  Who the hell notes down their bank details on their computer!?! Normally when breaking into systems, I'm used to seeing nice executables to steal or decrypted files to decypher. Never before have I seen someone leave something as precious as bank details on their system...
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  I'm not complaining, I can use the money from Derek's account to buy me some new LED fans!</file>
