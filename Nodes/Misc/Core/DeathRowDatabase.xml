  As director of this program I am trying to log into this computer that I AM MEANT TO BE IN CONTROL OF and the IT staff have changed the password. AGAIN!
  
  This has happened far too many times and is costing our company my valuable time. From now on the password here should be kept as "texas" - a choice I made personally.
  I'm storing this memo in a secure location for future reference. I've put a date on it so that it can be used as legal material if you insist on wasting my time in the future.
  
  DO NOT MAKE ME REPEAT THIS!
