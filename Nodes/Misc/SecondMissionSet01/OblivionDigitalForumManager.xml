(ADMIN: Hannah) - Hey, have you guys seen our new IT technician?

(ADMIN: Jacob) - Yeah. Paul, what about him?

(ADMIN: Hannah) - He seems a bit too... serious about his work don't you think?

(ADMIN: Jacob) - Well just because he's serious doesn't mean he's professional.

(ADMIN: Hannah) - What you mean??

(ADMIN: Jacob) - He left a sticky note right next to his PC with his mail server login details on it! If that's not a lack of professionalism then what is?
(ADMIN: Hannah) - Hahaha wow! Give me them and I'll spam the team out with cat photos >:D

(ADMIN: Jacob) - Ooooh! Good idea. It'll teach him to be more careful I suppose. I'll get them for you now

(TrashsweeperTymek) - Hey I'd like to make a complaint about your newest game "Nano Ninja".
