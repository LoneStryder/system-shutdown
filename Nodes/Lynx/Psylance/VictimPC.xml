  <file path="home" name="Compensation">I am pleased to inform you that an investigation is underway about the attack on your personal computer. We have yet to catch the hacker responsible, however the trail is strong.
  
  In the meantime, we hope that the compensation you have received is enough to get you back on your feet after this terrible incident.
  
  Thanks for placing your faith in Psylance's hands and I hope to see you around the offices again soon.
  
  Yours faithfully - D. Phelps (Head of the Psylance Internal Investigations Division) </file>
